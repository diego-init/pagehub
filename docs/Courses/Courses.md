## <u>__CIV1599 - CIV1599 S: Analytics for Transit and Mobility Systems (UofT Summer 2024)__</u>

Transit agencies around the world witness a growing trend of data abundance and diversity, presenting opportunities to enhance transit system effectiveness but requiring specialized knowledge and experience with analytics for harnessing such data. Transportation agencies and companies overseeing other modes and emerging mobility services are faced with the same challenges. This course provides students with in-depth exposure to emerging data types, sources and standards for transit and other mobility systems . The course will cover a range of analytics for harnessing diverse data in a variety of  planning and management applications. While special focus will be given to transit applications, other mobility modes and services will be considered as appropriate.

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, students will:

* gain in-depth knowledge in various transit and mobility data types, sources and standards;
* demonstrate competence in data analysis and modelling;
* apply appropriate analytical methods to different types of transit problems and selected mobility applications;
* gain hands-on experience in commercial and open-source tools; and
* communicate results in attractive visual and textual forms.
